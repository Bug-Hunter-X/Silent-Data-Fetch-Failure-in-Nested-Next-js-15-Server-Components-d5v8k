# Silent Data Fetch Failure in Nested Next.js 15 Server Components

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Next.js 15's server components: silent failures during deeply nested data fetching. When an API call fails within a chain of nested server components, the error isn't always propagated effectively, leading to incorrect rendering without explicit error messages.

## Bug Description
The issue occurs when multiple server components are nested, each fetching data. If one API call fails, it may not trigger a visible error; instead, outdated or missing data are rendered.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the behavior of the application and how it handles API failures in a nested component structure.

## Solution
The solution involves implementing comprehensive error handling within each server component's data fetching logic and propagating errors up the component tree effectively.
