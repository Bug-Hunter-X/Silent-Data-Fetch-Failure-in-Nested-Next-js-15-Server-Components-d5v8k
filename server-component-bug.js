In Next.js 15, a particularly uncommon bug arises when using server components with deeply nested data fetching.  Imagine a scenario where you have multiple layers of server components, each fetching data from an external API. If one of these API calls fails, it might not trigger an error in the usual way. Instead, it can lead to a silent failure, where the component renders with seemingly correct structure but displays outdated or incomplete data.  The problem is compounded because error boundaries might not catch this particular type of silent data failure within server components.
